<center><h2>Vegetable Lasagna is what you make when you want to load up on veggies with something that’s filling</h2></center>
<center><p>This incredible Vegetarian Lasagna is made with a creamy ricotta and spinach filling as well as layers of roasted vegetables and a homemade tomato lasagna sauce. It’s one of my favourite fridge clean out recipes because it can be made with just about any roastable veggies!</p></center>
