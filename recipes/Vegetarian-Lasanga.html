<h3>Reciepe Notes</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Veggies-</strong>feel free to use any vegetables you want, just cut them so they roast in around 20 to 25 minutes. Cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, squash are some I've used in the past.</li>
  <li><strong>Ricotta-</strong>It's best to get ricotta over the counter at the deli, even at supermarkets, rather than buying in tubs unless it's a brand you know is good like Paesanella. Harris Farms brand ricotta is also good. I find ricotta in tubs at supermarkets is typically grainy and kind of powdery - even the "big" brands (like Perfect Italiano)</li>
  <li><strong>Tomato Passata-</strong>is pureed tomato, just plain tomato with no flavourings. It is so good for making sauces like this because it's smooth even without cooking it down for ages ie no tomato lumps. It comes in tall bottles and is better value than canned tomato (by weight). Found in the pasta aisle of supermarkets in Australia - it's becoming increasingly popular. I like to use a combination of passata and crushed tomato for for texture and flavour.
    If you can't find passata, use the same weight of crushed tomato.</li>
  <li><strong>Roasted Red Peppers-</strong>optional, adds sweetness and extra flavour dimension. I use Always Fresh. You could just add chopped capsicum / bell peppers to the roasted vegetables</li>
  <li><strong>Lasagna Sheets-</strong>I like using fresh lasagne sheets sold in the fridge section. If you can only get dried, use No Boil sheets for convenience, or if required pre cooking, cook the lasagna sheets per the packet directions.</li>
